        <h1>Dihedral Group D3</h1>
        <p>This group represents symmetry of equilateral triangle by rotation and reflection. In the animation below, <span class="math inline">$$\\rho$$ represents rotation by $$120$$&deg; and <span class="math inline">$$r$$</span> represents reflection along the axis that bisects triangle. </span></p>
        <p>The symmetry group follows all four axioms of group and the binary operator for this group is composition <span class="math inline">$$\\circ$$.</span>Group operation is defined by <span class="math inline">$$a \\circ b$$, which means apply $$b$$ on triangle then apply $$a$$</span></p>
